# Dynamic LOCC Circuits for Automated Entanglement Manipulation
----
This repository contains the official QuAIRKit implementation of the DLOCCNet framework.

DLOCCNet is a general and flexible framework to design and optimize LOCC protocols. 

## Installation
---
The minimum Python environment for QuAIRKit is `3.9`. We recommend installing QuAIRKit with Python `3.10`.

```bash
conda create -n quair python=3.10
conda activate quair
conda install jupyter notebook
```

We recommend the following way of installing QuAIRKit with pip,

```bash
pip install quairkit
```
